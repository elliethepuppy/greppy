# Usage:
`./grep.py <"string to search"> <"/path/to/file"> <show line numbers: [y]/n> <case-sensitive: y/[n]>`

## Clarifications:
The `<show line numbers>` option must be given if choosing to match case sensitivity. Putting anything other than "n" there will default to "y". Same for `<case-sensitive>`\'s default.
